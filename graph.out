The Graph has the following attributes:
1. Number of nodes = 8
2. Adjacency Matrix = 
[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
3. Connected? = Disconnected
4. Raidus = Infinity
5. Diameter = Infinity
6. Girth = 3.0
7. Circumference = 4.0
8. Bridges = [The Graph is disconnected, it contains no bridges and there is no way to find any bridge]
